# engineering-reflections

### Tell me 'bout your `term-world` time

This repository--which ought to be stored within your `workshop`--is meant to be a living document wherein you reflect on your experiences in `term-world`.

One of the running expectations of working in, playing in, and otherwise inhabiting `term-world` is that at at the end of each week you will a series of questions about your time in `term-world`.
Your reflections--while inaccessible to other students--will be reviewed regularly by the instructor.
These questions are meant to not only give you a chance to document your own growth as a burgeoning computer scientist, but to also provide feedback to the instructor about the overall classroom experience.
Given the *highly* experimental nature of this class, having qualitative feedback about the student experience is invaluable for developing the course to be as meaningful (and instructive) as possible.

Since this reflection repository is uniquely *yours*, you'll be the one responsible for building it! You'll need to use terminal commands (or File Explorer options) to create new files and folders, and the onus of keeping your reflections organized is on *you*.
At the bottom of this readme are instructions for creating new folders and new files, which you will want to reference at least the first time you create new files in your reflection repository.

### The Questions

TO-DO: DETERMINE WEEKLY QUESTIONS
TO-DO: DETERMINE FOLDER/FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS FOR STUDENTS TO FOLLOW (FOR GRADER CHECKS)

### Making a new file or folder via the File Explorer

With the `engineering-reflections` folder highlighted, select the "New File" button at the top of the File Explorer.
(It looks like a piece of paper with a plus sign, and will only appear when your cursor is hovering over the Explorer.)
**When naming the file, make sure to end the file name with `.md` to indicate that it's a Markdown file.**

You can also select the "New Folder" button next to it to create new folders.

### Making a new file or folder via terminal commands

Using commands such as `cd` and `ls`, navigate to the `engineering-reflections` directory within the terminal window.
Once you're in, you can use the `touch` command to create a new file.
Simply enter `touch` followed by a single space and the name you'd like to give your new file.
**As with using the File Explorer, make sure your file name ends with `.md` to indicate that it's a Markdown file.**

If you'd like to make a new folder, use the `makedir` command (think, "make directory").
Simply enter `makedir` followed by a single space and the name you'd like to give your new folder.
